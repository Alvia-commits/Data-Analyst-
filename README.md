Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the job market for Data Analyst roles using the given dataset. The dataset contains information such as job titles, salaries, company ratings, locations, industries, and job descriptions. By exploring this data, we can understand which companies and industries hire the most, where the highest demand is, and what skills are most commonly required for Data Analyst positions.

The analysis focuses on answering key questions such as:
- How many Data Analyst jobs exist in this dataset?
- Which job titles, companies, and locations dominate the market?
- What industries are hiring the most?
- Which skills appear most frequently in job descriptions?

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

Before analyzing the data, several steps were taken to ensure accuracy and usability:
- Removed duplicate records to avoid counting the same job multiple times.
- Handled missing values by removing rows with essential missing data (like job title or company name) and keeping non-essential missing values for analysis context.
- Dropped irrelevant columns such as Competitors and Easy Apply due to excessive missing data (-1 values in most rows).
Standardized column formats by:
- Converting salary to numeric format where possible.
- Cleaning text columns (removing extra spaces, converting to lowercase for skill extraction).
- Filtered for Data Analyst-related roles to ensure the analysis focuses only on relevant job listings.
